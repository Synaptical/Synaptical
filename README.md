# Synaptical


A typical Synaptical system has two levels: Ambient and Cosmos

## Ambient

Ambient is all devices physically within the border of, or close to your home. They communicate to each others via WiFi, Bluetooth LTE, XBEE or other close range techologies.

At this level security is not first priority, low energy consumption and seamless integration between devices are more important.

## Cosmos

Or in other word, the Internet


## Gatekeeper

The one sit between Ambient and Cosmos
